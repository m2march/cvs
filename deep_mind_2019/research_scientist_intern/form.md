# COVER LETTER

/**
 *  * CS bachelor + master. PhD CS. Cognition in time. LIAA.
 *  * Original question: affect in music -> expectation -> models of cognition
 *  * Work thus far: beat expectation model, experiment, rhythmic complexity,
      paper in progress, posters at smpc. interaction psych and comp. model
 *  * Future work: bayesian modeling: adaptation and then HBMs. Looking into
      certainty of transformers. Further experimentation and publication.

# IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD IN SUPPORT OF YOUR APPLICATION?

/*
No direct application of ML in my PhD, experience from courses, reading and lab
discussions.

PhD on learning to design experiments, deal with data, learn from other
disxiplines (neuro and psych).
