# IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD IN SUPPORT OF YOUR APPLICATION?

I have previously worked at Google as an Intern in 2014. The experience was
very rich and helped me learn great practices both for coding and how to carry
on great projects.

I am currently developing my research at the Applied Artificial Intelligence
Lab at Universidad de Buenos Aires. In our lab we apply machine learning
techniques to real-life problems. The lab works interdisciplinary with a
common interest for the entire spectrum of modeling intelligence, from
neuroscience to applied ML. The team is made up of computer scientists,
engineers, biologists, physicists and linguists. This has allowed me to learn
from a variety of disciplines, from technical deep learning to experimental
neuroscience. ML examples include people working on speaker recognition,
turn-taking in dialog and prediction of mental illness from text. Neuroscience
research includes topics such as predictability in text, patterns of
information lookup from eye movement or changes in brain connectivity in kids
after playing games.
