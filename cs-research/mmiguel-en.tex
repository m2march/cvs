%\section{Mission Statement}

%\begin{flushleft}
%I have always been driven by curiosity and problem-solving. This drive took me
%to study Computer Science as a mean to gain the ability to ask good
%questions, find rigorous answers and carry them into real world solutions.
%Throughout my career I have developed both my applied and academic skills. I
%have worked in industry and acquired methodology and know-how and I am now
%working on my PhD degree, learning from research papers and performing
%experiments. Having curiosity as my main motor I have outed from strict
%computer science into empirical sciences, mainly neurosciences. I am
%interested in human perception and the interaction with each other and the
%world. I am currently trying to add knowledge about how we process the world
%and create expectations about the future. More specifically, I am working on
%modeling musical expectations, as it is a familiar
%semi-structured stimuli that makes a good first step in that direction.

\subsection{Publications}
\publication{(In preparation) Bayesian beat expectation and uncertainty}
{Martin A. Miguel, Mariano Sigman, Diego Fernandez Slezak}
{Paper describing a model of beat expectation evaluated against experimentally 
captured responses of tapping. To be presented in \emph{Music Cognition
Journal}.}

\publication{(Under Review) Analysis of the behaviour of a beat tracking
model to estimate pulse clarity}

\publication{A continuous model of pulse clarity: towards inspecting affect
through expectations in time}
{Martin A. Miguel, Mariano Sigman, Diego Fernandez Slezak}
